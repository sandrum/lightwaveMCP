lw_mcp_modeler_query.py

Read-path plug-in for Modeler (ROADMAP.md item 5). Modeler has no
Master-plugin/LWComRing equivalent - its Python plugin architecture is
CommandSequence-only (confirmed via Glob against the local install:
support/plugins/scripts/Python/Modeler/ only has a CommandSequence
folder, no Master folder). That turns out not to matter.

A CommandSequence plug-in registers as a normal invocable command,
exactly like built-in commands "New", "MergePoints", etc. - and
`modeler_run_command` in server.py already proves arbitrary named
commands are invocable over Modeler's Command Port (confirmed live
earlier this project via command="new" changing the title bar). A
public third-party Modeler plug-in
(github.com/heimlich1024/OD_CopyPasteExternal, found via web search)
confirmed that `mod_command.argument` carries whatever trailing text
was passed when the command was invoked - that project's Layout side
runs `lwsdk.command('ModCommand_OD_LWPasteFromExternal Layout')` and its
Modeler side reads `mod_command.argument` to get back `"Layout"`.

So: invoke this command by name with a trailing "command arg"-style
argument, read it back via mod_command.argument inside process(),
dispatch, and write the answer to a response file. Each call runs
synchronously and returns - no listener, no ring, no persistent state,
so none of the crash risk or activation flakiness that Layout's
LWComRing path had (see PLAN.md).

The mesh-reading pattern in _get_object_info is lifted directly from
NewTek's own bundled sample
(support/plugins/scripts/Python/Modeler/CommandSequence/
enumerate_surfaces.py) - editBegin/fastPointScan/fastPolyScan/
polyInfo/done - proven safe, and used here read-only (nothing is
modified).

SETUP (once per fresh Modeler session):
  Utilities > Plugins > Add Plugins > lw_mcp_modeler_query.py
  (registers the command - no separate "activation" step needed, unlike
  Layout's Master Plugins panel).
