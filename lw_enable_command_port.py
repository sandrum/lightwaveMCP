"""
lw_enable_command_port.py

Run this ONCE, inside LightWave Layout, to turn on Layout's built-in
Command Port (an official, NewTek-supplied network interface for
remotely driving Layout - see lwcommandport.html / globalcommandport.html
in the LightWave 2019 Python SDK docs, and the bundled Python client at
support/python/lwcommandport in your LightWave install).

This is a "single-shot" Generic plug-in (see "Anatomy of a LightWave
Python Plug-in" -> "Single-Shot Exceptions" in the SDK docs): no class,
no ServerRecord needed. Load it via Utilities > Plugins > Add Plugin,
then invoke it once from the Utilities/Python menu (or a hotkey). You
only need to do this again if you restart Layout.

Despite the SDK doc's phrasing ("TCP/IP port"), the underlying wire
protocol used by the bundled Python client is UDP - that's confirmed by
reading support/python/lwcommandport/__init__.py directly (it uses
socket.SOCK_DGRAM). Nothing to do about that here; just keep it in mind
if this doesn't connect and you go looking with a packet sniffer.
