MCP bridge between Claude and LightWave Layout, built on LightWave's
official Command Port.

VERIFIED STATUS (tested live against LightWave 2019.1.5, see PLAN.md for
the full log of what was tried):

- WRITES work end to end. lw.AddNull("TestFromMCP") sent from this
  machine's Python over UDP to Layout's Command Port produced a real Null
  item in the live scene, confirmed visually. Any of the ~800 native
  Layout commands exposed by the bundled `lwcommandport` client (copied
  here from support/python/lwcommandport in the LightWave install) should
  work the same way via lw_run_command below.

- READS now work too, via LWComRing (not LWEVNT_COMMAND - that was a
  confirmed dead end, see PLAN.md). The working mechanism, found in
  NewTek's own bundled sample
  (support/plugins/scripts/Python/Layout/Master/command_port_test.py):
  a Master plug-in calls lwsdk.LWComRing().ringAttach(
  lwsdk.LW_PORT_COMMAND_PORT, self, self.ring_event) and receives Command
  Port traffic wrapped as "{Topic} message". The client-side Ring(topic,
  command) method that formats that wrapper already existed in NewTek's
  bundled lwcommandport client - but it has a real bug under Python 3:
  `"{{0}} {1}".format(topic, command)` produces the literal string
  "{0} message" instead of "{MCP} message" (doubled braces escape to a
  literal brace instead of substituting). Confirmed live via
  _mcp_ring_debug.log. Fixed in lwcommandport/__init__.py.

  See lw_mcp_ring.py for the Master plug-in that must be loaded (Add
  Plugins) AND activated (Master Plugins panel) once per Layout session,
  alongside lw_enable_command_port.py.

    already established SelectItem(name) is not reliable for Camera/
    Light the way it is for Objects, and every camera/light-targeting

    CONFIRMED LIVE: zoom_factor and aperture_height take effect
    immediately (aperture_height's effect on focal_length_mm, given a
    fixed zoom_factor, is a real physical relationship, not a
    coincidence). f_stop ALSO confirmed live, but only after Depth of
    Field is enabled on the camera (native DepthOfField() command, a
    toggle with no direct read-back) - LightWave pops "This option only
    applies when Depth of Field is turned on" and silently no-ops
    otherwise. shutter_open/shutter_efficiency/rolling_shutter have the
    same kind of precondition (LightWave pops "This option only applies
    when Particle Blur or Motion Blur is turned on") - RESOLVED (see
    PLAN.md "Camera property writes" for the full story): the wrapped
    MotionBlur() was missing its argument entirely (fixed in
    lwcommandport/layout/__init__.py, same class of bug as the earlier
    Ring()/SetRenderDisplay() fixes) - it's a real enable/disable
    command (MotionBlur(1)/MotionBlur(0)), not the argument-less toggle
    it looked like from its own docstring. Confirmed live: after
    sending MotionBlur(1), all three shutter properties correctly read
    back the values previously set (they'd been silently accepted but
    not yet visible, the same way f_stop is before DepthOfField() is
    on - the underlying value sticks even while the precondition
    blocks it from taking visible effect). Call
    lw_run_command("MotionBlur", [1]) once per session before relying

    numeric-ID SelectItem fix as lw_set_camera/lw_set_target. Confirmed
    live: intensity and color take effect immediately.

    falloff_type write confirmed live via UI screenshot (Light
    Properties showed the new "Intensity Falloff" setting immediately)
    - but lw_get_light_info's own falloff field is a known-stale read
    that never reflects it, an unfixed limitation documented in
    lw_mcp_ring.py's _get_light_info. falloff_type is also a real
    LightWave constraint, not a bug: it only applies to Point/Spot
    lights, confirmed via LightWave's own error dialog ("This option
    does not apply to the current light type") when tried on a Distant
    light. cone_angle only matters for spot/cone-type lights - not
    independently visually confirmed the way falloff_type was.

    Deliberately does NOT cover LightVisibleToCamera/LightCastsShadows.
    Both are confirmed-live, genuine argument-less TOGGLES (Cmd History
    shows a bare "LightVisibleToCamera"/"LightCastsShadows" with no
    following number after clicking their checkboxes - unlike
    MotionBlur, which looked the same way but turned out to take a real
    argument; this pair does not), so there's no way to set them to a
    known state or read one back. Use lw_run_command
    ("LightVisibleToCamera", []) / lw_run_command("LightCastsShadows",
    []) directly if needed, the same way lw_run_command("DepthOfField",

    confirmed live: "Visible to Camera" is itself grayed out/disabled
    in the UI for Point lights - only Spot and Distant lights can use
    it at all, the mirror image of falloff_type's Point/Spot-only
    restriction.

    Also fixed a real bug found while building this: lwcommandport's
    LightFalloffType was defined TWICE (once correctly taking a `type`

    silently keeps only the second definition, so the argument version

    lw_render_scene are one-way fire-and-forget commands with no
    built-in completion signal, so this reads real callback-driven
    state over the LWComRing read path instead of guessing based on
    elapsed time.

    Multi-frame lw_render_scene progress tracking confirmed live and
    working: frame_count correctly climbs across a multi-frame render
    rather than jumping straight to done or stalling (not once per
    whole render session - open()/close() fire only once for the
    entire sequence; the real per-frame signal is IFrameBuffer.begin(),
    found via NewTek's own bundled sample plug-in after this project's
    own code had never overridden it). One real subtlety: begin() fires
    once per ENABLED RENDER BUFFER per frame (Render Properties >
    Buffers), not once per frame alone - confirmed live with
    Final_Render+Alpha both enabled (frame_count reached 8 for a
    4-frame render) vs. Final_Render alone (a clean 4). Divide
    frame_count by the number of enabled Render-column buffers if an
    exact frame count matters for a given scene. Also fixed a real bug
    in the same investigation: frame_count was continuing to climb
    across separate lw_render_scene calls within one Layout session
    instead of resetting - now resets on each new render.

    Requires a ONE-TIME manual setup step beyond the usual Add Plugins +
    Master Plugins dance: lw_mcp_render_monitor.py must additionally be
    selected as the active Render Display (Render Globals > Render
    Display tab). This can now also be done over the network via
    lw_run_command("SetRenderDisplay", ["LW MCP Render Monitor"]) -
    contrary to this tool's own earlier assumption, the native command
    does take an argument (confirmed via Cmd History showing a real
    "SetRenderDisplay LW MCP Render Monitor" entry); the wrapped
    lwcommandport method was just missing it (fixed). Before the
    display is set, or before any render has been triggered this
    session, rendering will be null, not a real in-progress/done state.
    Also: the Render Display dropdown selection appears to persist as a
    UI preference across sessions even though the underlying plug-in
    class needs re-loading via Add Plugins each fresh session, AND that
    reload can lock if the plugin is currently the active display -
    switch the display away first (e.g. to "Image Viewer"), reload,
