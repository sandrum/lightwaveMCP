lw_mcp_ring.py

Read-path Master plug-in for the Claude <-> LightWave MCP connector, built
on the *real* mechanism for receiving Command Port traffic: LWComRing.

Why this replaces lw_mcp_master.py (LWEVNT_COMMAND approach): that was a
confirmed, empirically-tested dead end - event() never fired for Command
Port traffic no matter what. The correct mechanism, found in NewTek's own
bundled example (support/plugins/scripts/Python/Layout/Master/
command_port_test.py, shipped with every LightWave 2019.1.5 install), is:

  1. Hold an lwsdk.LWComRing() instance.
  2. In inst_acquire(), call self._comring.ringAttach(
       lwsdk.LW_PORT_COMMAND_PORT, self, self.ring_event)
  3. Command Port traffic arrives at the ring_event(client_data, port_data,
     event_code, event_data) callback, event_code 0.
  4. Decode the raw bytes with self._comring.decodeData(('s:256',),
     event_data) -> a 1-tuple containing the string.
  5. Messages are expected in the form "{Topic} rest of message" - this
     matches the Ring(topic, command) method already present in the
     bundled lwcommandport client library's CommandPort base class, which
     formats exactly that: "{%s} %s" % (topic, command).

So the external client calls lw.Ring("MCP", "ping") (or "get_scene_info"),
which sends "{MCP} ping" over the same UDP Command Port used for AddNull
etc. This plug-in listens for the "MCP" topic specifically and writes its
answer to _mcp_response.json, which server.py polls (unchanged protocol
from the old, non-working attempt - only the delivery mechanism changes).

SETUP (must be done every fresh Layout session, same as the Command Port
itself):
  1. Utilities > Plugins > Add Plugins > lw_mcp_ring.py (registers the
     class - unlike the old single-shot enable script, this ships a
     ServerRecord so it needs a second step below).
  2. Utilities > Master Plugins > "Add Layout or Scene Master" dropdown >
     select "LW MCP Ring" > make sure its "On" checkbox is ticked.
     (Confirmed in earlier testing: LWMAST_LAYOUT-flagged masters still
     need this explicit activation step - just loading via Add Plugins is
     not enough to get inst_acquire() called.)
